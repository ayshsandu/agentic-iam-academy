          Ensuring agents have the minimum level of access required to perform their tasks.

        <p>
          The Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) is a foundational concept in information security. It dictates that any user, program, or process—including an AI agent—should have only the bare minimum privileges necessary to perform its function. The goal is to limit the potential damage that can be caused by accident, error, or a security breach.
        </p>
        <h2>PoLP in the Age of Agentic AI</h2>
        <p>
          In an agentic architecture, where agents can autonomously access data and execute actions, enforcing PoLP is more critical and complex than ever. An over-privileged agent represents a significant security risk. If compromised, it provides an attacker with a powerful foothold inside the system.
        </p>
        <h2>Key Aspects of PoLP Enforcement for Agents:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Fine-Grained Permissions:</strong> Moving beyond simple read/write roles to define specific actions an agent can take on specific resources (e.g., "can read customer_email but not customer_pii").</li>
          <li><strong>Context-Aware Policies:</strong> Permissions are not static; they can change based on context like time of day, agent's location, or the data being accessed.</li>
          <li><strong>Default-Deny Stance:</strong> An agent should have no permissions by default. Access must be explicitly granted.</li>
          <li><strong>Regular Access Reviews:</strong> Periodically reviewing and attesting to an agent's permissions to ensure they are still necessary and appropriate.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Enforcing PoLP requires a centralized authorization system that can manage and evaluate complex permission models, and it works hand-in-hand with concepts like Just-in-Time (JIT) access to provide a layered defense.
