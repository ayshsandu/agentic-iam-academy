          Securely creating, managing, and decommissioning agents.

        <p>
          Just like employees, AI agents have a lifecycle. They are created (onboarded), they perform their duties, their permissions might change over time, and eventually, they are decommissioned (offboarded). Managing this entire lifecycle securely is a critical IAM function.
        </p>
        <h2>Challenges in Managing Agent Lifecycles</h2>
        <p>
          The sheer number and ephemeral nature of agents can make manual lifecycle management impossible. An organization might deploy thousands of specialized agents, some of which may only exist for a few seconds. This requires a highly automated and policy-driven approach.
        </p>
        <h2>Phases of Agent Lifecycle Management:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Creation/Onboarding:</strong> Securely bootstrapping an agent's identity, assigning initial permissions based on its role, and provisioning necessary credentials.</li>
          <li><strong>Operational Management:</strong> Modifying permissions as the agent's role evolves, rotating credentials, and monitoring its activity.</li>
          <li><strong>Decommissioning/Offboarding:</strong> When an agent is no longer needed, it's crucial to completely and irrevocably terminate its identity and all associated permissions and credentials to prevent orphaned accounts.</li>
          <li><strong>Dormancy:</strong> Handling agents that are temporarily inactive, perhaps by suspending their permissions until they are needed again.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Effective agent lifecycle management prevents the accumulation of stale, over-privileged accounts that are a common target for attackers. It ensures that the principle of least privilege is maintained throughout an agent's entire existence.
