# Page: What is Agentic AI? (/what-is-agentic-ai)

Title: What is Agentic AI?
Definition: Agentic AI refers to a type of artificial intelligence system that can act autonomously and proactively to achieve specified goals. Unlike traditional AI models that simply respond to prompts, agentic systems can create plans, execute multi-step tasks, and adapt to new information without constant human oversight.

Key Characteristics:
- Goal-Oriented: Operates with a specific objective in mind.
- Autonomous: Can make decisions and take actions on its own.
- Proactive: Can initiate actions to move closer to its objective.
- Adaptive: Learns from its interactions and the environment.
- Interactive: Can communicate and collaborate with users, other AI agents, and external systems.

Why Agentic AI Matters Now: The rise of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 has been the catalyst, providing the "brain" for agents. It's the shift from a "thinking" AI to a "doing" AI.

The IAM Challenge: How do we grant these autonomous agents the permissions they need without giving them excessive access? Defining, managing, and securing the identity and permissions of these non-human workers is a core challenge.

Title: Why IAM Matters for Agentic AI - Securing the Autonomous Workforce

The Double-Edged Sword of Autonomy: The autonomy that makes agents powerful also makes them a significant security risk. Without robust identity and access controls, they can be a liability.

The Core Problem:
- Identity (Authentication): How do we verify that an agent is who it claims to be?
- Access (Authorization): Once authenticated, what is this specific agent instance allowed to do?

Traditional IAM vs. Agentic IAM Challenges:
- Scale: Potentially millions of agents vs. thousands of human employees.
- Temporality: Agents might exist for only a few seconds.
- Context: Permissions may need to change dynamically per task.
- Non-Person Entities (NPEs): Agents are not people and must be managed programmatically.

Title: Deep Dive: The Agent Identity Problem

What is an AI Agent's Identity?: An agent has no inherent, physical identity. The challenge is to distinguish one instance of code from another and verify its legitimacy.

Why Is This So Hard?: Traditional identity methods (passwords, biometrics) don't apply well to agents. Storing secrets like API keys is a management and security challenge, especially for ephemeral agents.

Analogy: The Corporate Badge: An agent needs a digital equivalent of a corporate badge - a verifiable, temporary credential that grants specific access and can be revoked.

The Broader Problem Space includes:
- Agent Identity Problem (This Page)
- Dynamic Authorization
- Ephemeral Credentials
- Secure Introduction
- Delegation & Impersonation
- Auditing & Observability

Title: The Core Challenges of Agentic IAM

These are the interconnected challenges in securing an autonomous workforce:
- Agent Identity Problem: How do we prove an agent is who it claims to be? (Published)
- Dynamic Authorization: Granting fine-grained, context-aware permissions. (Coming Soon)
- Ephemeral Credentials: Issuing short-lived, single-use credentials. (Coming Soon)
- Secure Introduction: How two agents or an agent and a service establish trust. (Coming Soon)
- Delegation & Impersonation: How an agent can safely act on behalf of a user. (Coming Soon)
- Auditing & Observability: Maintaining a comprehensive log of agent actions. (Coming Soon)

Title: Core Concepts of IAM

- Identity: A unique representation of a subject (user, device, agent) with a set of attributes.
- Authentication (AuthN): The process of verifying a claimed identity. For agents, this could be API keys, client certificates, etc.
- Authorization (AuthZ): Determines what actions an authenticated identity is allowed to perform on which resources.
- Single Sign-On (SSO): Principles can be adapted for agents needing to interact with multiple services.
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): A form of MFA could be implemented for critical agent actions, like requiring human approval.
- Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP): An identity should only be granted the minimum permissions necessary to perform its tasks.

# Page: Best Practices (/best-practices)

Title: Best Practices for Agentic IAM

- Enforce Strong Authentication for Agents: Use short-lived tokens (e.g., OAuth 2.0) and rotate credentials.
- Implement the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP): Grant agents only the exact permissions needed for the shortest time.
- Establish and Manage Agent Identities: Every agent should have a unique, auditable identity (e.g., service accounts).
- Regularly Audit and Review Permissions: Continuously monitor agent activity and permissions.
- Secure Agent-to-Service Communication: Encrypt all communication (e.g., mTLS).
- Centralize Identity and Policy Management: Use a centralized Identity Provider (IdP).

Title: Real-World Scenarios

- Agent Accessing Internal APIs:
  - Problem: An autonomous agent needs to access internal microservices.
  - Solution: Use OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow. The agent has its own identity.
- Agent Accessing Third-Party SaaS:
  - Problem: An AI assistant needs to post to Slack or GitHub.
  - Solution: Use a service account/bot user from the provider and store keys in a secrets manager.
- Agent Acting on Behalf of a User:
  - Problem: A personal AI assistant needs to access a user's emails or calendar.
  - Solution: Use OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow with PKCE. The user grants consent (scopes).

# Page: Glossary (/glossary)

Title: Glossary of IAM Terms

- API Key: A simple secret token to authenticate a client.
- Bearer Token: A security token where possession is sufficient for access.
- JSON Web Token (JWT): A compact, URL-safe standard for creating digitally signed access tokens.
- OAuth 2.0: An authorization framework for applications to obtain limited access to user accounts.
- OpenID Connect (OIDC): An identity layer on top of OAuth 2.0.
- Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML): An open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data.
- Scope: In OAuth 2.0, specifies the exact permissions an application is requesting.
